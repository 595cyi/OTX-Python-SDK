Open Threat Exchange is an open community that allows participants to learn about the latest threats, research indicators of compromise observed in their environments, share threats they have identified, and automatically update their security infrastructure with the latest indicators to defend their environment.

OTX Direct Connect agents provide a way to automatically update your security infrastructure with pulses you have subscribed to from with Open Threat Exchange. By using Direct Connect, the indicators contained within the pulses you have subscribed to can be downloaded and made locally available for other applications such as Intrusion Detection Systems, Firewalls, and other security-focused applications.
